## Three other markdown-formatted contents:
### 1.Task list
Task lists are great for tracking items. Use - [ ] for unchecked and - [x] for checked items:
- [x] Write Markdown guide
- [ ] Add examples for each element
- [ ] Proofread content

### 2.Horizontal rule
a horizontal rule is a line used to visually separate content. It’s often utilized to break up sections, provide a clear division between topics, or make the text easier to read.
To create a horizontal rule in Markdown, use three or more dashes (---), underscores (___), or asterisks (***) on a single line.

Content above the line.
